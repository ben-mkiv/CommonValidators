# CommonValidators
Collection of validators that are useful for all projects.

### Installation
Copy this plugin to either your PRROJECT_DIR/Plugins or ENGINE_DIR/Plugins folder.

### How it works
This plugin adds three new validators to the Data Validation system in Unreal Engine. These validators will run automatically when you save an asset.

## Validators

### Blocking Load
This validator scans Blueprints for nodes that perform synchronous (blocking) asset loading, which can cause hitches and performance issues. It specifically looks for `LoadAsset_Blocking` and `LoadClassAsset_Blocking` function calls.
***

### Empty Tick
This validator identifies `EventTick` nodes in Blueprints that are not connected to any other nodes (i.e., they do nothing). These empty ticks still have a performance cost, so the validator flags them for removal. This check is only active for Unreal Engine versions older than 5.6.
***

### Heavy Reference
**not working reliable as of now**

This validator checks for heavy hard references on other assets (default 2MB+). Classes can be excluded in the Project Settings.
***

### Pure Node
This validator checks for pure nodes (nodes without execution pins) that have more than one output pin connected. This is important because a pure node is re-executed for each connected output, which can be an unexpected and inefficient behavior. It includes a whitelist to exclude certain node types, like `UK2Node_BreakStruct`, from this validation.
***

### Material Texture Sampler Source
This validator checks the Texture Samplers source type in materials, it will throw a warning when the source is set to 'from Asset', which is default for backwards compatibility. For new projects one of the other source types should be preferred, see [Unreal Forums Thread](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/texture-sampler-source-why-not-use-shared-by-default/390231)
